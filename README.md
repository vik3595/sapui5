I have added all the files which are required for creating the UI. However, I didn't add the images, so that you can change the images as per your requirement.
Visibility of the controls are handled using property binding.

When app gets initialized, I've created a property "procType" in the model. On basis of the property type I am handling the visibility of the controls..
